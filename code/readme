code for this process

only one code file, but if multiple, naming scheme is 
`##-description` where ## is the number of the step (step 1 being ran first, step 2 second...)

if multiple versions of same code file (ie. wantimng to save a previous version of the code for whatever reason), the ## is the date of last edit on that version
